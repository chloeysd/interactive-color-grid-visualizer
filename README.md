# Interactive Color Grid Visualizer

## Overview
The Interactive Color Grid Visualizer is a Python application that utilizes OpenCV and seaborn libraries to create a dynamic grid of colored squares. The color of each square changes over time, and users can interact with the grid by clicking to alter the state of the squares.

## Features
- Dynamic color updates using a seaborn color palette.
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse clicks.
- Visual feedback based on user interactions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- numpy
- seaborn
- A custom `Animator` module

## Setup
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. If you haven't installed the libraries, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy seaborn
